				<p>Shiva (Siva) is one of the most important gods in the Hindu pantheon and is considered a member of the
					holy trinity (trimurti) of Hinduism with Brahma and Vishnu. A complex character, he may represent
					goodness,
					benevolence and serve as the Protector. He is also associated with Time, and particularly as the
					destroyer and creator of all things.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="lesson">
				<p>In Hinduism, the universe is thought to regenerate in cycles (every 2,160,000,000 years). Shiva destroys
					the universe at the end of each cycle which then allows for a new Creation. Shiva is also the great
					ascetic,
					abstaining from all forms of indulgence and pleasure, concentrating rather on meditation as a means to
					find perfect happiness. He also has a darker side as the leader of evil spirits, ghosts and as the master
					of
					thieves, villains and beggars. Shiva is the most important Hindu god for the Shaivism sect, the patron of
					Yogis and Brahmins, and also the protector of the Vedas, the sacred texts.</p>

				<p class="text lesson" id="familiya">Shiva's wife was Parvati, often incarnated
					as Kali and
					Durga. She was in
					fact a
					reincarnation of Sati (or
					Dakshayani), the daughter of the god Daksha. Daksha did not approve of Sati's marriage to Shiva and even
					went
					further and held a special sacrificial ceremony to all the gods except Shiva. Outraged at this slight,
					Sati
					threw herself on the sacrificial fire. Shiva reacted to this tragedy by creating two demons (Virabhadra
					and
					Rudrakali) from his hair who wreaked havoc on the ceremony and beheaded Daksha. The other gods appealed
					to
					Shiva to end the violence and, complying, he brought Daksha back to life but with the head of a ram (or
					goat).
					Sati was eventually reincarnated as Parvati in her next life and she re-married Shiva.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="text">With Parvati, Shiva had a son, the god Ganesha. The boy was in fact created out of earth and
					clay to keep
					her
					company and protect her while Shiva went on his meditative wanderings. However, Shiva returned one day
					and,
					finding the boy guarding the room where Parvati was bathing, he enquired who he was. Not believing the
					boy was
					his son, and thinking him an impudent beggar, Shiva called up the bhutaganas demons who fought the boy
					and
					eventually managed to distract him with the appearance of the beautiful Maya and, whilst he admired the
					beauty,
					they lopped off his head. At the commotion, Parvati rushed from her bath and screamed that her son had
					been
					killed. Realising his error, Shiva then sent for a new head with which to make the boy whole again but
					the
					nearest at hand was of an elephant. And so Ganesha, the elephant-headed god, was born. Other sons of
					Shiva are
					Skanda or Karttikeya, the god of war and Kuvera, the god of treasures.</p>
			</div>

				<p class="text">
					Ganga (the goddess who personified the river Ganges) was given to Shiva by Vishnu who could
					not take any
					more
					of the constant quarrels between his then three wives of Lakshmi (goddess of good fortune), Saraswati
					(goddess
					of wisdom) and Ganga. To cushion Ganga's fall to the earth, and prevent such a great river destroying
					civilisation, Shiva caught her in his hair topknot; once again, illustrating his quality of
					self-sacrifice.</p>

			<p>As with any major god, Shiva was involved in many adventurous episodes which illustrate his virtuous
				character
				and offer instruction on how to live correctly. For example, self-sacrifice is emphasised when Vasuki, the
				king
				of Serpents, threatened to vomit snake venom across the seas. Shiva, assuming the form of a giant tortoise
				or
				turtle, collected the venom in his palm and drank it. The poison burned his throat and left a permanent blue
				scar, hence one of his many titles became Nilakantha or Blue Throat.</p>
			<p>Another celebrated episode describes how Shiva became associated with the bull Nandi. One day, Surabhi, who
				was
				the original mother of all the world's cows, began to give birth to an untold number of perfectly white
				cows.
				The milk from all these cows flooded the home of Shiva, somewhere in the Himalaya. Angry at this disturbance
				to
				his meditation, the god struck the cows with fire from his third eye. In consequence, patches of the cows'
				hides were turned brown. Still angry, the other gods sought to calm Shiva down by offering him a magnificent
				bull - Nandi, the son of Surabhi and Kasyapa - which Shiva accepted and rode. Nandi also became the
				protector
				of all animals. Â­</p>
			<p>Shiva is closely associated with the Linga (or Lingham) - a phallus or symbol of fertility or divine energy
				found in temples to the god. Following the death of Sarti, and before her reincarnation, Shiva was in
				mourning
				and went to the Daru forest to live with rishis or sages. However, the wives of the rishis soon began to
				take
				an interest in Shiva. In jealousy, the rishis first sent a large antelope and then a gigantic tiger against
				the
				god but Shiva swiftly dealt with them and wore the tiger skin thereafter. The sages then cursed Shiva's
				manhood
				which, in consequence, fell off. When the phallus struck the ground, earthquakes began and the ricsis became
				afraid and asked for forgiveness. This was given but Shiva told them to forever after worship the phallus as
				the symbolic Linga.</p>

				<p>In Asian art Shiva may be represented in slightly different ways depending on the particular culture:
					Indian,
					Cambodian, Javanese etc. but he is most commonly depicted naked, with multiple arms and with his hair
					tied up
					in a topknot. He often has three horizontal stripes and a third vertical eye on his forehead. He wears a
					headdress with a crescent moon and a skull (representing the fifth head of Brahma, which he decapitated
					as
					punishment for the god lusting after his own daughter Sandhya), a necklace of heads, and snakes as
					bracelets.
					In this guise, he usually represents Nataraja and performs the Tandava cosmic dance within a circle of
					fire
					which represents the never-ending cycle of time. He holds the divine fire (agni) which destroys the
					universe
					and the drum (damaru) which makes the first sounds of the creation. One hand makes the calming
					abhayamudra
					gesture and another points to his left foot, symbol of salvation. He also stamps one foot on the dwarf
					figure
					Apasmara Purusha who represents illusion and who leads men away from the truth.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Shiva may also be depicted standing on one leg with the right leg folded in front of the left knee and
					holding
					a rosary in his right hand, the typical posture of ascetic meditation. Sometimes he also rides his white
					bull,
					carries a silver bow (Pinaka), holds an antelope, and wears a tiger or elephant skin, all symbolic of his
					famed
					prowess as a hunter.</p>
